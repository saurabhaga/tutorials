# Spring Autowiring

### This article demonstrates the Spring Autowiring with example.

## Key Points to understand
 - Spring Autowiring is “byType” followed by “ byName”.
 - **"byType"** - Determine beans by Type variables. 
 - **"byName"** - Determine beans by variables name. 
 - By default name of class with first letter small case will be the bean name.
 - We can  also define the name of Beans inside @Component("bean name") or @Bean("bean name").

Lets understand the key points with the help of real world example.

Assume we have an interface Car with its two implementation:
- Maruti
- Honda

Interface is defined as 

    public interface Car {
    }

Car interface has two implementations 
**Honda implementation**-   will have default name as "honda"


    @Component
    public class Honda implements Car {
    }

**Maruti implementation**-   will have default name as "maruti"

    @Component
    public class Maruti implements Car {
    }

One Test Component class 

    @Component
    public class TestComponent {
    
    @Autowired @Qualifier("maruti") private Car car; //1
    @Autowired private Honda hondaCar; //2
    @Autowired private Maruti marutiCar; //3
    @Autowired private Car honda;//4
    @Autowired private Car maruti;//5
    
    //  test method
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Car car=" + car);
        System.out.println("Honda hondaCar=" + hondaCar);
        System.out.println("Maruti MarutiCar=" + marutiCar);
        System.out.println("Car honda=" + honda);
        System.out.println("Car maruti=" + maruti);
        }
    }

**Output**

    Car car=com.example.Maruti@62577d6
    Honda hondaCar=com.example.Honda@49bd54f7
    Maruti MarutiCar=com.example.Maruti@62577d6
    Car honda=com.example.Honda@49bd54f7
    Car maruti=com.example.Maruti@62577d6

**Lets understand the reason of the output of the test program –**

 1. If we don’t add @Qualifier on line 1 then it will throw error as there are 2 implementations available and Spring will be confused which one to use.
 2. By default name of class with fist letter small case will be the bean name.
 3. For line number 2 and 3 there are no issues as the types are concrete implementations like Honda or Maruti.
 4. For line number 4 and 5 - **even though the type is car** , spring tries to use **“byname”** strategy because if finds 2 implementations as second strategy. With this Spring will find beans with the name “honda” and “maruti” which is same as the variable names used in line number 4 and  5
 5. For example, if we define `@Autowired private Car maruti1;`  -this will throw error as "byType" there are 2 choices and with "byName" there is no bean with name with maruti1 so Spring will greet us with an error.
